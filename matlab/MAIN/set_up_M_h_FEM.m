%%%%%% set up M from heat eqn, that is matrix representing the integrals
% of phi_i * phi_j (test functions)

function M_h = set_up_M_h_FEM(N, bdy_type)

% for now only do 1D
% matrix has a factor of h/6 in front and then 4's on diag
% 1 on both off diagonals
pts = N;
%pts = N-1;
temp = ones(pts,1);

% also eliminate entry in L_h(2,1) and L_h(N, N+1) to keep symmetry
% hence we have to update f(2) and f(N) later!
