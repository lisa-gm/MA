\textbf{Potential Reasons Why Doesn't Work Well}



\begin{itemize}
	\item really not a straight forward problem, dependent on the many parameters ... 
	\item maybe a space-time approach where future influencing the past isn't a great idea, should follow causality principle? 
	\item maybe the scaling ... how terms are weighted ... or this multigrid thing, since the algorithm seems to work alright for other problems ... unfortunate combination of things
	\item so many more things what to test, summarise what worked best. what seems to not work well at all
	
\end{itemize}
